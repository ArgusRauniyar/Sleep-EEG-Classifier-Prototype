# Sleep-EEG-Classifier-Prototype
A baseline machine learning pipeline for classifying sleep stages using the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset (sleep-cassette subset) from PhysioNet.org (low accuracy results)

EEG Sleep Stage Classification

The pipeline includes:
- Downloading and loading .edf sleep-cassette files
- Extracting EEG epochs and corresponding hypnogram labels
- Preprocessing and reshaping data for machine learning
- Training a Random Forest model
- Evaluating classification performance

Results
- Accuracy: ~0.55 (55%)
- Class-specific performance varies significantly, with some classes achieving high precision and recall (e.g., stage 3), while others have poor detection due to imbalanced and limited training samples.

Why Accuracy is Low
- The dataset used was small and imbalanced across sleep stages, causing the model to struggle with underrepresented classes. No advanced feature extraction or hyperparameter tuning was performed â€” the goal was to demonstrate a working end-to-end pipeline.

Usage
- Download EEG data from Sleep-EDF.
- Run the preprocessing and training script.
- View the classification report for performance metrics.

Note from the Author
- Due to limitations in downloading and storing large EEG datasets, the project was developed on a reduced dataset, preventing higher-order programming and computationally heavy approaches. The focus was on demonstrating functionality over optimization.

Future Plans
- Acquire and use a larger, more balanced dataset to improve generalization.
- Apply feature extraction techniques such as spectral band power, wavelet transforms, or time-frequency analysis.
- Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) for temporal pattern recognition.
- Perform hyperparameter optimization on the Random Forest or try alternative ML algorithms.
- Implement data augmentation for minority classes.
